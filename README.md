Holy Bible API with NodeJS, PostgreSQL and Sequelize

---

```javascript
    if(faithfulness(you.Faith) === true){
        const rules = require('sky_kingdom');
        you.heartHealth = rules.WORD_OF_THE_ETERNAL_LIFE;
        you.garnerFill(rules.PROMISSES_OF_GOD['the_best_of_earth']);
        you.memoryRecord.push(ISAIAH[1][19]);
    }
```
## The API
---

This API provides the chapters of the books in Bible by request. The output content is a JSON object containing only contents and metadata from the book and its requested chapter, that is, with all of its verses and cross-references.

The views in this project were experimental only and their routes will not be used in providing content.
